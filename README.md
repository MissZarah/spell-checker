# spell-checker

A simple word processor that reads a word as input and checks it against a dictionary. If the word exists in the dictionary then it is spelled correctly. However, if the word is not found in the dictionary, a list of suggested corrections which are the words in the dictionary that are “similar” to the
misspelled word are presented to the user.
